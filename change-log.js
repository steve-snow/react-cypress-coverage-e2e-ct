Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto' in 'C:\xxxxx\cypress-combo-coverage\node_modules\ws\lib'

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
        - add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "crypto": require.resolve("crypto-browserify") }'
        - install 'crypto-browserify'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
        resolve.fallback: { "crypto": false }

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'stream' in 'C:\xxxxx\cypress-combo-coverage\node_modules\ws\lib'
Did you mean './stream'?
Requests that should resolve in the current directory need to start with './'.
Requests that start with a name are treated as module requests and resolve within module directories (node_modules, C:\xxxxx\cypress-combo-coverage\node_modules).
If changing the source code is not an option there is also a resolve options called 'preferRelative' which tries to resolve these kind of requests in the current directory too.
